# QuantumNumbersCalculator
php algorithm used to calculate qnumtum numbers using the atomic number.

I converted the php algorithm to <a href="https://github.com/SamerAlabdaly/QuantumNumbersCalculatorV2">javascript</a> in the second version because if there is too much pressure on the server it might stop working (goes down).

and nobody even used it lol <br>
I tried to promote it in study groups on Facebook and no one accepted it even though it was very helpful to 5th graders.<br>
Regardless, many of my friends and family supported me on this project, and that's enough for me! :)<br>

please when you host this site on your own server please mention me on it, Thanks!<br>
